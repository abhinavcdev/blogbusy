# The Vibecoding Stack

To truly embrace vibecoding, you need the right tools. It's not about the most complex IDE, but the one that offers the least friction.

## 1. The Intelligent Editor: Cursor
Cursor has changed the game. It's not just VS Code with a plugin; it's an editor built *for* AI. With features like `Cmd+K` to edit and `Cmd+L` to chat, it keeps you in the code.
*   **Composer Mode**: Write entire features across multiple files with natural language.
*   **Context Awareness**: It knows your codebase better than you do sometimes.

## 2. Instant Deployments: Replit & V0
When the vibe strikes, you need to see it live.
*   **Replit**: From idea to hosted app in seconds.
*   **V0**: For UI generation that actually looks good.

## 3. The Atmosphere: Music
You can't vibecode in silence (well, some can, but the vibe helps).
*   **Lofi Girl**: The classic.
*   **Synthwave**: For when you're hacking the mainframe.
*   **Ambient Techno**: For deep focus.

## Conclusion
The stack is simple: AI to handle the grunt work, instant feedback loops, and an environment that fosters creativity. That's the stack.
